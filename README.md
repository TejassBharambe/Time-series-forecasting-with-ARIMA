# Time-series-forecasting-with-ARIMA

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a time series analysis and forecasting project aimed at predicting retail sales, with a specific emphasis on furniture sales from the Superstore dataset. The project utilizes various time series analysis techniques and employs the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for forecasting.

Time series analysis is a statistical method used to analyze and interpret sequential data points collected over time. It involves extracting meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from temporal datasets. In this project, we apply time series analysis to understand and forecast retail sales, specifically focusing on the furniture category.

The Superstore sales dataset serves as the foundation for this project. The dataset includes information on various categories, and our analysis centers around furniture sales. We explore patterns and relationships within this time series data to make informed predictions.

##Results
The project provides insights into the characteristics of furniture sales time series, including visualizations of trends and seasonality. The ARIMA model is employed for forecasting, with key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) used to evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts.
